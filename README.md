## First thing i have done is i have removed the google font after that i have optimized all pictures and i also minimized the CSS and used it in the index file. There were pictures used as links i have saved them into the img file and optimized them and called them from image file and also removed the javascript link (<script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/analytics.js"></script>)

## for the pizza file in the ChangepizzaSizes, first loop I had taken the sizes of the pizza and then in the second loop I had implemented the sizes of the pizza and for the function updatePositions I have declared scrollTop out of the loop .

## thank you .
